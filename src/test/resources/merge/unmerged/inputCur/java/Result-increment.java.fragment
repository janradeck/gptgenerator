/* Start of included file Result-increment.java.fragment */
/*
This file should be called ".prompt" in "real life"
It is  used to simulate the "unmerged" include

The order should be:
- This file is "merged" to Merge(Cur)
- This file in Merge(Cur) satifies the include dependencies for "Result.java"
- Result.java is merged to Merge(Cur)

Result.java will look "broken", because this prompt is included, and not the reply to this prompt
*/
For the java class

//#U(Result.java)#

create a method "void increment() which increments "count"
